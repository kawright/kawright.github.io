## Work History {#section-work}

### Dakota Internet Partners, Inc. (DakotaPro) - January 2018 to November 2021

During my 4 year tenure at DakotaPro--a wireless ISP providing managed services to residents and businesses in the Tucson, AZ region--I was responsible for designing, developing, documenting, testing, deploying, and supporting a large number of internal systems and employee tools. Here is a sample of what my department was able to accomplish during my tenure as lead engineer:

- Developed and maintained a REST API which allowed our cloud services to communicate with services on the company's private network in a secure manner.
- Developed client libraries for interfacing with various services--such as the *Tucows Platypus* ISP billing and ticketing software. These libraries allowed us to quickly develop software integrations, employee tools, and automation scripts.
- Developed and maintained Python scripts for handling long-distance billing and taxing for VOIP customers.
- Developed a toolset for testing and diagnosing issues on the customer network. These tools could be run by automated crawlers, through a web-interface available to customer service and tech support staff, or through a custom Slack bot (this functionality was later ported to the *Zoho Cliq* platform when the company made a change).
- Facilitated a migration of customer information from a legacy CRM and ticketing system on the company's private network, to a modern, cloud-based platform called *Zoho Enterprise* by developing integrations, extensions, and plugins to work between the two.
