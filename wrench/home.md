wrench - Simple Unit Testing for C
==================================

Welcome to the project page for **wrench**, a simple unit testing framework for C. *wrench* has everything you need to test your project in an easy-to-use API that won’t get in your way, stress you out, or make you learn and use a whole bunch of stuff you really don’t need.

Why Should I Use wrench Instead of My Favorite Unit Testing Framework?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few reasons you may want to consider using *wrench* on your current or next project:

- A unit testing framework, like any tool, should be both powerful and easy-to-use. *wrench* provides all of the necessary features you need to comprehensively test your C project-–including assertions, text fixtures, the ability skip tests and abort suites, and standardized output using the TAP protocol–-without making it difficult to use.
- *wrench* is about as featherweight as unit testing frameworks come, comprising of a single header file and a single implementation file. Getting started can be as simple as adding `wrench.c` to your sources and including `wrench.h` (although binaries are also available).
- *wrench* supports TAP output, which makes it a great choice to pair with TAP consumers for a powerful testing and reporting toolchain.
