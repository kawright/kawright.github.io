title: wrench - TODO
---

This list contains items that I plan to address in the future, in no particular order:

- [ ] Write and run unit tests for the implementation as of version *0.1.0*. This will most likely be the very next item to be addressed.
- [ ] Implement forked testing to allow things like segmentation faults to be caught and handled.
- [ ] Fix setter functions so that they can be called multiple times without causing memory leaks.
- [ ] Create a page for installation directions.
- [ ] Create a quickstart tutorial for using *wrench*.
