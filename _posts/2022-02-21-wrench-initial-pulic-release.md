wrench Initial Public Release
=============================

As was promised on the last post, I finished the API documentation for the initial public version of *wrench*, and I spun up a new project repo on GitLab for it last night. I also added a [page to the main site where I have links to all of my project pages](../projects). Here is where you can find the [wrench home page](../wrench/home). I also added binaries for this initial release (v0.1.0) on the [wrench releases page](../wrench/releases) page, although the easiest way (the one I personally recommend) to use *wrench* is probably just to add *wrench.c* to your source files and include *wrench.h* in your code.

Please keep in mind that the API for all pre-release versions (anything *v0.x.y*) is subject to unannounced changes at any time. You are welcome to use these versions, but please do so at your own risk.

Everyone is welcome to chime in on the *wrench* GitHub *issues* page. Everyone is also welcome to track the development of *wrench* on the GitHub *projects* page. Links to these can also be found on the [wrench home page](../wrench/home). 

The first thing I plan on tackling will be to write unit tests for the implementation as of *v0.1.0*. Keep checking in if you would like to read more about my attempt to create an Ourobouros by unit testing *wrench* using *wrench*.
