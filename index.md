Hey, I'm Kristoffer! Welcome to my blog!
========================================

Howdy, my name is Kristoffer A. Wright, and I am a software engineer who now
has his own blog! I've got four years of professional experience as a DevOps
engineer developing REST APIs and administering automated service integrations,
and I am ready to share my programming endeavours with the rest of the world!

Although this page is a great place to read about all of the projects I am 
working on and all of the great things I am learning about every day, its also
a wonderful place to read about my resume, including my contact info, my social
media accounts, my education and work history, and even a little bit about my
hobbies, including oil painting, drumming, and cooking.
